# PongGameVHDL
Here is the code of my digital design term project, which is an implementation of the classic arcade game Pong in VGA using basys3 FPGA board. The game is implemented using VHDL hardware description language. You can find a video description from the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqOlgilpCYc&t=36s
